          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h3>
          <p>Welcome to the D3 Times Newsroom! Our featured story this week will reveal 
            an important discovery on healthcare and lifestyle trends that shape our society
            these days. This article is based on the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates gathered 
            from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
          </p>

          <p>"Health is wealth" is what everybody says especially in this time of pandemic. 
            Different ways of living life based on our current status can affect our health.
            The data presented showed some key trends on relationship between health risks with
            age and income. 
            <ul>
              <li>There is a very positive relationship between smoking and age. A person increases
                their smoking habits as they age. Smoking induces a feeling of pleasure and over time,
                addiction. As we people age, comes more income to afford buying cigarettes and the increase 
                in responsibilities and stress that would give more reasons to smoke. The majority of the states
                with high smoking rates are seen on the Southeastern states like Tennessee, Kentucky,
                Arkansas and West Virginia with a high 26.7% smoking rate at age 42. This could be the effect
                of having very little opportunities in jobs to sustain a comfortable living situation to support
                a family or a preferred lifestyle. Compared to big cities having many opportunities like California and New York, the smoking 
                rates are much lower approximately 13-14% smoking rate at age 38.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>The lower the income, the higher the smoking rates. We see this trend again from Southeastern
                states. Mississippi has one of the highest smoking rate of 23% with the lowest income earnings of approximately
                $40K. Maryland has the highest income earnings of approximately $74K with a low smoking rate of 15%.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>The availability of healthcare does not create an impact on different poverty levels. Regardless of income and age,
                it seems that majority of the populations in every state are settling with the lowest to average healthcare coverage
                that will provide for their preventative visits and some may probably don't go for a doctor's visit unless they are sick.
                This is most likely due to the increasing healthcare costs.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
